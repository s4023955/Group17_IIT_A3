</p>

<h4><strong>Group Processes and Communication</strong></h4>
<p>
    Effective communication is one of the many essential factors that will lead to a successful group project. It is important to set up a clear direction for which medium and the recurrence of group communication to guarantee that group members are constantly updated and connected.
</p>

<p>
    We will communicate mainly through the combination of face-to-face meetings as well as online meetings through mediums such as Discord and Microsoft Team. When conducting these meetings, members of the group will have the opportunity to voice their thoughts and discuss the progress of the project, any new ideas will be heard and the group will be able to address any challenge/issues that will arise. The schedule of the group meeting will be notified by a member of the group via Email or Messenger,  in which all members will have the chance to pick the ideal time.
    In order to stay in touch and keep updates with others, virtual tools will be used to keep track of tasks needed to be done for members to know what needs to be done before the next meeting.
</p>

<p>
    When making decisions, current issues will be brought up for team members to voice their opinion on how the issues should be handled, team members are encouraged to share their solutions while others remain actively listening to their perspectives.
</p>
<p>
    Once all perspectives have been heard, the team will try to weigh out each solution and evaluate options to come to an agreement on how the issues will be dealt with. If the best course of action is still not determined by then, other decision-making tools might be involved to help us reach a full consensus.
    When conflicts within the group arise, we motivate team members to have clear and honest communication between the members. By sharing respectful conversation and with active listening skills within the group members, many conflicts would be resolved. If all is done and the conflict is still not resolved, the group would seek advice from project supervisors to help come up with a solution.
</p>

<p>
    Based on a source, “Conflict occurs frequently in any workplace: health care is not an exception. The negative consequences include dysfunctional team work, decreased patient satisfaction, and increased employee turnover. Research demonstrates that training in conflict resolution skills can result in improved teamwork, productivity, and patient and employee satisfaction.”
</p>
<p>
    Beside addressing any conflicts that arise, protocols need to be established for each team member’s task assignment and how the decision-making process should be finalized. To ensure that all group members have the opportunity to voice their concern, we aim to make decisions collectively.
</p>
<p>
    With a clear guideline to ensure that communication of  team members remains effective and active, our group will be able to achieve effective team collaboration, also be able to operate at a high level of efficiency leading to progress being made for the projects.
</p>

<h1>Group Reflection</h1>
<p>
    Tuan Nguyen: <br>
    After working with group 17 for 10 weeks, I have learned many things from my team members. From time-working organize to communicate, each aspect of this helps me improved my social and teamwork skills into another levels. Even though it can be done in the past but RMIT's university has created an opportunity to study Face to face.
However, From my perspective the team could be more productive if we have more time to critical thinking as well as having more study session for a major project as assignment 3 and the final test. I believe that the project and presentation could be much better and the mark will be significantly improved if the group have more time to work with.
This first semester in RMIT has been a new chapter for me, as myself have found a spectacular group with many good teammate has really changed my opinions on working as a team.
