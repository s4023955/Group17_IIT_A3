<h1>Team Profile</h1>
<p>The groups official name is Young Sheep (might change after group meeting)</p>

<p>
    My name is Nguyen Anh Tuan, student ID: s4023955. I have been interested in gaming since ten years old. Besides that, I enjoy playing soccer as a left back defender and striker as well. I studied in Western Sydney University for 2 years before moving back to RMIT Sai Gon. Mainly because I want to change my Major when I finally know what to learn for my family business, also because my result in the last 2 years was not very good and the lack of knowledge about Information Technology. When I was a student in Sydney, I have been interacted with different types of computer languages, such as C#, java, HTML, CSS, SQL, R,... but not in a professional levels.

These chatbots employ their computational ability and access to mathematical information to assist users in understanding concepts, performing calculations, and overcoming challenges they may have when studying or working on math-related tasks. Math chatbots' exact goals can vary depending on their design and target audience. Among the common goals are:</p>
<p>
- Problem solving: Math chatbots can help users solve mathematical problems by providing solutions, explanations, and the necessary steps to reach the answer.<br>
- Conceptual understanding: Chatbots can explain mathematical concepts and theories in a way that is easy to comprehend.<br>
- Skill development: Math chatbots can help users improve their mathematical skills by offering practice questions, quizzes, and interactive exercises.<br>
- Quick calculations: Math chatbots can perform calculations, such as arithmetic operations, conversions, and solving equations, swiftly and accurately.<br> 
Besides, we will make our chatbot be able to assisting in homework and test preparation.
</p>

<h4><strong>Testing</strong></h4>
<p>Testing a math chatbot involves verifying its accuracy, analyzing its responses, and ensuring that it handles various scenarios correctly. These are the steps that we planned to testing it:</p>
<p>
- Define test cases: Identify a set of test cases that cover a variety of math problems, including basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and calculus. Include cases with both simple and complex problems.<br>
- Test basic arithmetic: Begin by testing the chatbot's ability to handle fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Check that the chatbot calculates the correct results for various inputs.<br>
- Test algebraic expressions: Examine the chatbot's comprehension of algebraic expressions, such as simplification, equation solving, and factoring. Test it with various phrases to confirm that it processes them correctly.<br>
- Test word problems: Evaluate the chatbot's ability to interpret and solve math word problems. Test it with a variety of word problems to see if it can extract essential information, perform the necessary calculations, and deliver correct answers.<br>
- Test complex math concepts: Examine the chatbot's understanding of advanced math concepts, such as trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. Ask it questions related to these topics and verify the accuracy of its responses.<br>
-  Test error handling: In order to see how the chatbot responds, intentionally enter incorrect or invalid math questions. When confronted with unsupported or illogical input, ensure that it displays suitable error messages or questions the user for explanation.<br>
- Test integration with chat platform: If the math chatbot is linked to a certain chat platform or application, verify its functionality in that context. Examine whether it replies appropriately inside the chat interface, accurately processes user input, and maintains a smooth discussion flow.<br>
- Evaluate response quality: Besides checking the accuracy of the answers, assess the overall quality of the chatbot's responses. Consider factors like clarity, coherence, and readability. Ensure the chatbot explains its steps or provides relevant explanations when necessary.<br>
- User experience evaluation: Assess the overall user experience by considering factors such as response time, clarity of explanations, and the chatbot's ability to engage in natural language conversations. Solicit feedback from users or testers to gather insights on the chatbot's performance and usability.<br>
- Bug reporting and tracking: Document any bugs or issues encountered during testing. Provide detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and expected versus actual results. Use a bug tracking system to track and prioritize these issues for resolution.<br>
- Iterate and improve: Keep track of any issues, errors, or inconsistencies that arise during testing. Use this feedback to fine-tune and improve the performance of the chatbot. Iterate and retest the chatbot on a regular basis to verify its correctness and efficacy.

   - Problem Types: Determine the types of mathematical problems the chatbot will be able to handle, such as solving equations, simplifying expressions, factoring polynomials, finding derivatives, or solving word problems. <br>
   - User Interaction: Specify the level of interaction the chatbot will support, such as accepting natural language input, providing step-by-step explanations, offering hints, or engaging in a conversation to clarify problem statements. <br>
   - Platforms and Integration: Decide on the platforms where the chatbot will be available, such as a website, mobile app, or integration with messaging platforms like Zalo, Viber or Facebook Messenger. <br>

        2. Limits: <br>
    - Complexity: Define the complexity level the chatbot can handle. Complex problems may require significant computational resources or may not be feasible to solve within the constraints of a chatbot. <br>
    - Accuracy and Reliability: Establish the expected accuracy and reliability of the chatbot's solutions. Mathematical calculations should be accurate, and the chatbot should be able to handle a wide range of inputs without errors. <br>
    - Knowledge Coverage: Determine the depth of mathematical knowledge the chatbot will possess. It should be able to handle common problems and concepts within its defined scope, but it may not have expertise in highly specialized or niche areas of mathematics. <br>
    - Natural Language Understanding: Consider the limits of the chatbot's natural language understanding capabilities. While it can interpret and respond to a wide range of user inputs, there may be some ambiguous or complex queries it may struggle to understand accurately. <br> </p>

<p>It's important to define the scope and limits of the project early on to manage expectations, prioritize features, and allocate appropriate resources. As the project progresses, it may be possible to expand the scope or enhance the limits based on user feedback and evolving requirements.</p>
