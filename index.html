<h2>Project Detail</h2>
<h4><strong>Aims</strong></h4>
<p>
    Math chatbots strive to help users solve mathematical issues by providing explanations and step-by-step guidance in a variety of fields of mathematics.  These chatbots employ their computational ability and access to mathematical information to assist users in understanding concepts, performing calculations, and overcoming challenges they may have when studying or working on math-related tasks. Math chatbots' exact goals can vary depending on their design and target audience. Among the common goals are:
</p>
<p>
- Problem-solving: Math chatbots can help users solve mathematical problems by providing solutions, explanations, and the necessary steps to reach the answer.<br>
- Conceptual understanding: Chatbots can explain mathematical concepts and theories in a way that is easy to comprehend.<br>
- Skill development: Math chatbots can help users improve their mathematical skills by offering practice questions, quizzes, and interactive exercises.<br>
- Quick calculations: Math chatbots can perform calculations, such as arithmetic operations, conversions, and solving equations, swiftly and accurately.<br> 
Besides, we will make our chatbot be able to assisting in homework and test preparation.
</p>

<h4><strong>Plans and Progress</strong></h4>
<p>
    An important goal is to develop chatbots that can increase the understanding of a conversation's overall context over time of interactions. If we aim to achieve this, we need to implement a feedback mechanism. For example, our project aims to develop an AI math tool that can help students maintain a good relationship with their math skills; to achieve this, we aim to implement a feedback mechanism allowing users to provide detailed feedback on the Quality of Response (QoR). This way, the feedback from users can be utilized as a model for training and focus on improving that chatbot's overall performance. <br>
    We will also work on ways to help build up the integration of our AI chatbot with backend systems, databases, and APIs. By achieving this, our chatbot will have more access and utilize more information provided with a much higher accuracy level of responses. <br>
    Based on a source, "A chatbot is a typical example of an AI system and one of the most elementary and widespread examples of intelligent Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It is a computer program, which responds like a smart entity when conversed with through text or voice and understands one or more human languages by Natural Language Processing (NLP)." <br>
    The main concern is how we address the ethical issues revolving around chatbots. <br>
    How we will provide users with privacy, data security, and transparency in our chatbot's operations. Suppose a user requests an answer to a specific task. In that case, our chatbot can access information from the external database or API to provide the users with a much more accurate response. We will implement a mechanism to help detect and reduce any biases in our chatbot's responses. <br>
    Another improvement we aim to work on is creating a chatbot that will be tailored to a specific field of study. This specialized chatbot will be able to provide much more tailored responses that will be relevant to users in this field. According to another source, "The adoption of educational chatbots is on the rise due to their ability to provide a cost-effective method to engage students and provide a personalized learning experience." <br>
    Our main goal for the project is to improve the overall circumstances understanding within the chatbot. As the project progressed, the importance of integrating the chatbot with backend systems and being able to address its ethical concerns was a must. Other than that, we need to progress in areas such as developing a specialized chatbot for a specific field of study. <br>
    The group will regularly keep the chatbot up to date with the models based on our users' feedback, new data that came up will also be integrated within the chatbot and any changes that will be required. The hybrid approach that includes rule-based and machine-learning approaches will also help complement its limitations. <br>
    We intended to keep up to date with any new methods of improving the chatbot's ability to comprehend and predict its user intentions. This will include its ability to understand and respond to natural language queries by processing machine learning algorithms to improve the understanding of the user's input to provide a more relevant and accurate response to their tasks.
</p>
<h5>project's stages</h5>
<p>
    Research and Planning (2-3 months): Within this phase, our group will research existing mathematical chatbots and any technologies deemed relevant to our project. Achieving this milestone will allow us to have complete comprehension of the current state of a mathematical chatbot; we can find out functions that the other bots are lacking and identify opportunities for any new solution for our chatbot. By doing a thorough research and planning process, we will also be able to identify the targeted audiences for our chatbot, what the audiences are seeking from a mathematical chatbot or any challenges we can address. Based on the information gathered from the process, we can define the basic features and functionalities the chatbot will provide. From then, we can derive a clear project plan within the group and outline any critical factors that must be focused on.
    Design and Architecture (2-3 months): During this phase, our group will be able to distinguish and design a user-friendly interface for the chatbot, focusing mainly on the convenience and accessibility of the chatbot. We will also need to decide by then on the proper architecture method used to develop the bot, whether it is (rule-based, machine learning, or hybrid) based on the information we have gathered and the resources available to us. As a group, we will also have to decide and integrate all the natural language processing (NLP) techniques required for the chatbot to understand and respond to the user's queries effectively.
    Development (12-16 months): Within this phase, the chatbot's core functionalities will be implemented, mainly focusing on its mathematical problem-solving capabilities. Advanced mathematical algorithms and the chatbot's mathematical library will be combined to increase its ability to solve complex calculations. An intelligent conversation flow will also be introduced into the chatbot functionality, and a rapid response generator within the system. In order to ensure its accuracy and efficiency, the group will perform diligent testing and debugging to ensure no problems may arise.
    Iterative Refinement (3-4 months): In order to refine the chatbot to ensure ease of use, we will collect users' feedback throughout our beta testing process. By analyzing the user's interaction with the chatbot's performance during the test, we will be able to refine and optimize the chatbot's functionality, hoping to improve the interaction between the users and the chatbot.
    Deployment on User Feedback (2-3 months): Finally, the last phase will consist of the team's ability to prepare the chatbot for actual deployment on any platform that we wish, whether it will be on the web or mobile, etc. By monitoring our user feedback on the chatbot, we will make adjustments that will lead to the improvement of our chatbot, ensuring that it provides the users with better interaction and efficient support.
</p>
<h5>Group Processes and Communication</h5>
<p> Effective communication is one of the many essential factors that will lead to a successful group project. Therefore, it is crucial to set a clear direction for which medium and the recurrence of group communication to guarantee that group members are constantly updated and connected. <br>
    We will communicate mainly through the combination of face-to-face meetings as well as online meetings through mediums such as Discord and Microsoft Teams. When conducting these meetings, members of the group will have the opportunity to voice their thoughts and discuss the progress of the project; any new ideas will be heard, and the group will be able to address any challenges/issues that will arise. A member will notify the schedule of the group meeting of the group via Email or Messenger, in which all members will have the chance to pick the ideal time. In order to stay in touch and keep updated with others, virtual tools will be used to keep track of tasks needed to be done so members know what needs to be done before the next meeting. <br>
    When making decisions, current issues will be brought up for team members to voice their opinion on how the issues should be handled; team members are encouraged to share their solutions while others remain actively listening to their perspectives. <br>
    Once all perspectives have been heard, the team will try to weigh out each solution and evaluate options to agree on how the issues will be dealt with. If the best course of action still needs to be determined by then, other decision-making tools might be involved to help us reach a complete consensus. <br>
    When conflicts within the group arise, we motivate team members to have clear and honest communication between the members. Many conflicts would be resolved by sharing respectful conversation and active listening skills among the group members. If all is done and the Conflict still needs to be resolved, the group would seek advice from project supervisors to help come up with a solution. <br>
    Based on a source, "Conflict occurs frequently in any workplace: health care is not an exception. The negative consequences include dysfunctional teamwork, decreased patient satisfaction, and increased employee turnover. However, research demonstrates that training in conflict resolution skills can improve teamwork, productivity, and patient and employee satisfaction." <br>
    Besides addressing any conflicts that arise, protocols need to be established for each team member's task assignment and how the decision-making process should be finalized. Finally, to ensure that all group members have the opportunity to voice their concerns, we aim to make decisions collectively. <br>
    With a clear guideline to ensure that communication of team members remains effective and active, our group will be able to achieve effective team collaboration; our group will be able to operate at a high level of efficiency, leading to progress being made for the projects.

    </p>



<h4><strong>Group Processes and Communication</strong></h4>
<p>
    Effective communication is one of the many essential factors that will lead to a successful group project. It is important to set up a clear direction for which medium and the recurrence of group communication to guarantee that group members are constantly updated and connected.
</p>

<p>
    We will communicate mainly through the combination of face-to-face meetings as well as online meetings through mediums such as Discord and Microsoft Team. When conducting these meetings, members of the group will have the opportunity to voice their thoughts and discuss the progress of the project, any new ideas will be heard and the group will be able to address any challenge/issues that will arise. The schedule of the group meeting will be notified by a member of the group via Email or Messenger,  in which all members will have the chance to pick the ideal time.
    In order to stay in touch and keep updates with others, virtual tools will be used to keep track of tasks needed to be done for members to know what needs to be done before the next meeting.
</p>

<p>
    When making decisions, current issues will be brought up for team members to voice their opinion on how the issues should be handled, team members are encouraged to share their solutions while others remain actively listening to their perspectives.
</p>
<p>
    Once all perspectives have been heard, the team will try to weigh out each solution and evaluate options to come to an agreement on how the issues will be dealt with. If the best course of action is still not determined by then, other decision-making tools might be involved to help us reach a full consensus.
    When conflicts within the group arise, we motivate team members to have clear and honest communication between the members. By sharing respectful conversation and with active listening skills within the group members, many conflicts would be resolved. If all is done and the conflict is still not resolved, the group would seek advice from project supervisors to help come up with a solution.
</p>

<p>
    Based on a source, “Conflict occurs frequently in any workplace: health care is not an exception. The negative consequences include dysfunctional team work, decreased patient satisfaction, and increased employee turnover. Research demonstrates that training in conflict resolution skills can result in improved teamwork, productivity, and patient and employee satisfaction.”
</p>
<p>
    Beside addressing any conflicts that arise, protocols need to be established for each team member’s task assignment and how the decision-making process should be finalized. To ensure that all group members have the opportunity to voice their concern, we aim to make decisions collectively.
</p>
<p>
    With a clear guideline to ensure that communication of  team members remains effective and active, our group will be able to achieve effective team collaboration, also be able to operate at a high level of efficiency leading to progress being made for the projects.

<h1>Group Reflection</h1>
<p>
    Tuan Nguyen: <br>
    After working with group 17 for 10 weeks, I have learned many things from my team members. From time-working organize to communicate, each aspect of this helps me improved my social and teamwork skills into another levels. Even though it can be done in the past but RMIT's university has created an opportunity to study Face to face.
However, From my perspective the team could be more productive if we have more time to critical thinking as well as having more study session for a major project as assignment 3 and the final test. I believe that the project and presentation could be much better and the mark will be significantly improved if the group have more time to work with.
This first semester in RMIT has been a new chapter for me, as myself have found a spectacular group with many good teammate has really changed my opinions on working as a team.
</p>

    Chuong Dinh: <br>
    Nothing much to say about myself right now. When I looked back at my progress throughout this course, I think I performed okay, especially the first time I am keeping track
    of the progress and manage the parts of other members. However, in the demonstration on Wednesday this week, I did poorly because my preparation was not clear enough,
    which rarely happened for me thus I need to improve my ability to do so even without scripts. Beside those weak points, everything went well without any major problems
    at all. One thing I’m amazed about this semester is to have teammates studying abroad and showing me useful tips & tricks that I've never heard of. During thetime I’ve
    been here, I’ve learned how to manage stuff, thinking in many ways and using support tools like ChatGPT to assist me for work.
</p>
