<h1>Team Profile</h1>
<p>The groups official name is Young Sheep (might change after group meeting)</p>

<p>
    My name is Nguyen Anh Tuan, student ID: s4023955. I have been interested in gaming since ten years old. Besides that, I enjoy playing soccer as a left back defender and striker as well. I studied in Western Sydney University for 2 years before moving back to RMIT Sai Gon. Mainly because I want to change my Major when I finally know what to learn for my family business, also because my result in the last 2 years was not very good and the lack of knowledge about Information Technology. When I was a student in Sydney, I have been interacted with different types of computer languages, such as C#, java, HTML, CSS, SQL, R,... but not in a professional levels.

        1. Wolfram Alpha: Wolfram Alpha is a powerful computational knowledge engine that can answer a wide range of mathematical queries. It can perform symbolic and numerical calculations, solve equations, plot graphs, and provide step-by-step solutions. It also covers various other domains beyond mathematics, such as physics, chemistry, and finance. <br>

        2. Mathway: Mathway is a popular online platform and mobile app that offers step-by-step solutions to math problems. It covers various math topics, including algebra, calculus, trigonometry, and statistics. Users can enter their problems, and Mathway provides both the solution and the steps involved in reaching that solution. <br>

        3. Symbolab: Symbolab is another mathematics-focused platform that provides step-by-step solutions and symbolic calculations. It covers a wide range of math topics, including algebra, calculus, statistics, and differential equations. Symbolab also offers graphing capabilities and provides explanations for each step in the solution process. </p>

<p>These competitors offer similar functionalities to a mathematical chatbot and provide solutions to a wide range of math problems. However, there can be differences in terms of user interface, supported platforms, pricing models, and the depth of mathematical topics covered. Some chatbot-specific differences could include the conversational interface, natural language understanding capabilities, and the ability to interpret and solve math problems expressed in natural language.

It's important to note that the landscape of mathematical chatbots and related products may evolve over time, with new entrants and advancements in existing platforms. Therefore, it's always a good idea to research the latest offerings to get a comprehensive view of the available options and their points of difference.
