<h1>Team Profile</h1>
<p>The groups official name is Young Sheep (might change after group meeting)</p>

<p>
    My name is Nguyen Anh Tuan, student ID: s4023955. I have been interested in gaming since ten years old. Besides that, I enjoy playing soccer as a left back defender and striker as well. I studied in Western Sydney University for 2 years before moving back to RMIT Sai Gon. Mainly because I want to change my Major when I finally know what to learn for my family business, also because my result in the last 2 years was not very good and the lack of knowledge about Information Technology. When I was a student in Sydney, I have been interacted with different types of computer languages, such as C#, java, HTML, CSS, SQL, R,... but not in a professional levels.

My name is Chuong Dinh, student number is s3891640. I prefer to use my school provided email(s3891640@rmit.edu.vn) for work. I'm born and grown up in HCM city. As for my
hobbies, I enjoy watching TV, playing sports and video games, through I haven't playing sports for a long time. Despite being in Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering major, I also have some interest in IT jobs and their potential, so I decided to take part in this
course.

<h2>Project Detail</h2>
<p>
+ Aims: Math chatbots strive to help users solve mathematical issues by providing explanations and step-by-step guidance in a variety of fields of mathematics.  These chatbots employ their computational ability and access to mathematical information to assist users in understanding concepts, performing calculations, and overcoming challenges they may have when studying or working on math-related tasks. Math chatbots' exact goals can vary depending on their design and target audience. Among the common goals are:<br>
- Problem solving: Math chatbots can help users solve mathematical problems by providing solutions, explanations, and the necessary steps to reach the answer.<br>
- Conceptual understanding: Chatbots can explain mathematical concepts and theories in a way that is easy to comprehend.<br>
- Skill development: Math chatbots can help users improve their mathematical skills by offering practice questions, quizzes, and interactive exercises.<br>
- Quick calculations: Math chatbots can perform calculations, such as arithmetic operations, conversions, and solving equations, swiftly and accurately.<br> 
Besides, we will make our chatbot be able to assisting in homework and test preparation.</p>
 
<p>
+ Testing: Testing a math chatbot involves verifying its accuracy, analyzing its responses, and ensuring that it handles various scenarios correctly. These are the steps that we planned to testing it:<br>
- Define test cases: Identify a set of test cases that cover a variety of math problems, including basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and calculus. Include cases with both simple and complex problems.<br><br>

- Test basic arithmetic: Begin by testing the chatbot's ability to handle fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Check that the chatbot calculates the correct results for various inputs.<br><br>

- Test algebraic expressions: Examine the chatbot's comprehension of algebraic expressions, such as simplification, equation solving, and factoring. Test it with various phrases to confirm that it processes them correctly.<br><br>

- Test word problems: Evaluate the chatbot's ability to interpret and solve math word problems. Test it with a variety of word problems to see if it can extract essential information, perform the necessary calculations, and deliver correct answers.<br><br>

- Test complex math concepts: Examine the chatbot's understanding of advanced math concepts, such as trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. Ask it questions related to these topics and verify the accuracy of its responses.<br><br>

- Test error handling: In order to see how the chatbot responds, intentionally enter incorrect or invalid math questions. When confronted with unsupported or illogical input, ensure that it displays suitable error messages or questions the user for explanation.<br><br>

- Test integration with chat platform: If the math chatbot is linked to a certain chat platform or application, verify its functionality in that context. Examine whether it replies appropriately inside the chat interface, accurately processes user input, and maintains a smooth discussion flow.<br><br>

- Evaluate response quality: Besides checking the accuracy of the answers, assess the overall quality of the chatbot's responses. Consider factors like clarity, coherence, and readability. Ensure the chatbot explains its steps or provides relevant explanations when necessary.<br><br>

- User experience evaluation: Assess the overall user experience by considering factors such as response time, clarity of explanations, and the chatbot's ability to engage in natural language conversations. Solicit feedback from users or testers to gather insights on the chatbot's performance and usability.<br><br>

- Bug reporting and tracking: Document any bugs or issues encountered during testing. Provide detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and expected versus actual results. Use a bug tracking system to track and prioritize these issues for resolution.<br><br>

- Iterate and improve: Keep track of any issues, errors, or inconsistencies that arise during testing. Use this feedback to fine-tune and improve the performance of the chatbot. Iterate and retest the chatbot on a regular basis to verify its correctness and efficacy.</p>
