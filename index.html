<h1>Team Profile</h1>
<p>The groups official name is Young Sheep (might change after group meeting)</p>

<p>
    My name is Nguyen Anh Tuan, student ID: s4023955. I have been interested in gaming since ten years old. Besides that, I enjoy playing soccer as a left back defender and striker as well. I studied in Western Sydney University for 2 years before moving back to RMIT Sai Gon. Mainly because I want to change my Major when I finally know what to learn for my family business, also because my result in the last 2 years was not very good and the lack of knowledge about Information Technology. When I was a student in Sydney, I have been interacted with different types of computer languages, such as C#, java, HTML, CSS, SQL, R,... but not in a professional levels.
